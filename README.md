# TrustSource nuget integration

This repo contains several plugins. Two for Visual Studio, one for Teamfoundation Server/Services. Two have been designed to support .NET-framework, one has been designed to support .Net-Core.

## .Net-Framework & Visual Studio Integration
In the [/TrustSource](https://github.com/eacg-gmbh/ecs-nuget/tree/master/TrustSource) folder you will find a commandline tool to manage .Net-Core-Analysis. The Visual Studio Plugin can be found in the [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TrustSource.vsp4dotnetcore)

We are currently seeking feedback on the different implementations. Feel free to contact us and let us know about your expereince. Our next step will be to combine the different .Net solutions into one. Feel free to provide us with your suggestions.

## .Net-Framework & TFS Integration

To make use of the TFS plugin, please follow these steps:

1.	Install Node.js
If not yet available on the server, download nodeJS at https://nodejs.org/en/download/ and perform installation. The installation may differ depending on your OS. Then make sure your environment has the correct path settings (to make npm command available)

2.	Install tfs-cli
Go to https://github.com/Microsoft/tfs-cli to install the TFS command line interface.

3.	Configure basic authorization
See https://github.com/Microsoft/tfs-cli/blob/master/docs/configureBasicAuth.md on how to configure your authentication.

4.	Create temporary files folder 
Provide a folder to secure temporary files, e.g. c:\temp\buildtasks

5.	Execute at command prompt with administrator rights

  `tfx login --auth-type basic`
  for a Service URL use a string such as 'http://studio:8080/tfs/DefaultCollection'  
  All the other parameters are optional

  `tfx build tasks create `
  Use “CheckLicenses” as a first parameter name

6.	Open file CheckLicenses/task.json and copy the value of the “id” field

7.	Open task.json file and paste the copied “id” value there.

8.	Execute at command prompt with administrator rights:

 ` tfx build tasks upload --task-path CheckLicenses `
 
 or if the task already on the TFS and you want update it:
 
 `tfx build tasks upload --task-path CheckLicenses --overwrite`
